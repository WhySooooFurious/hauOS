# hauOS

A debloated GSI of Lineage19.1.

Renamed to hauOS.

You might be thinking *why*, Lineage is already debloated, well I know that obviously, I was like *why not*. This was a personal project for me, I wanted a light GSI in which I didn't have apps I would use on a phone I liked tinkering with. It only took a day and a bit. I'm quite pleased with the result.

I deleted useless system packages and stock apps. Do not use this if you intend for you phone to work as a phone. It'll turn your phone into a glorified tablet.

Pros: 

- Decreased RAM usage (200-300mb decrease)
  
- Debloated system apps (Only apps are Browser, Files and Settings)

- First and subsequent boots are faster
  
That's pretty much it, everything else I experienced was likely a placebo, this image exhibits the same amount of performance if not a bit better than the original image.

Cons:

There is probably a lot more broken than the list down below...

- Most likely will only work with Samsungs
- Calling/Messaging will not work
- Cannot choose wallpapers
- Even if you install stocks apps, they will most likely not work

I will continue modifying this to my liking, keep in mind that this is working on my Samsung Galaxy A12 and might not work for you.
